# Dungeon Adventure Game

### Game Summary

You play as an adventurer exploring a mysterious dungeon made up of connected rooms arranged on a grid. As you move from room to room, you encounter enemies and find items like Healing Potions. Your goal is to survive by managing your health, collecting useful items, and defeating hostile creatures. To win, you must explore the dungeon, defeat all enemies you encounter, and keep your player alive by strategically using your inventory and engaging in combat.

## Description

This is a simple text-based dungeon adventure game written in Java. The game uses multiple classes to simulate a grid-based dungeon with rooms, enemies, and items. The player navigates the dungeon using commands, fights enemies, collects and uses items like healing potions, and tries to reach the final bossâ€”the Dungeon Lord.

## Features
